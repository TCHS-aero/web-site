			<h2>About Us.</h2>
			<p>Why did we found TCHS Aero?</p>
			<h2>Who we are.</h2>
			<h3>Temple City High School’s autonomous aviation team.</h3>
			<p>
				Our team is working together to merge flight and artificial inteligence to create an optimized automated drone for the college-level SUAS competition in June 2026. Since the summer of 2024, we've been laying the groundwork by testing budgets, analyzing the difficulty of our craft, and planning our team structure.
				Now, we're ready to recruit and make TCHS Aero official.
			</p>
			<h2>What do we do?</h2>
			<h3>
				Hands-On Innovation
			</h3>
			<p>
				Our sub teams: Programming, Mechanical/Electrical, and Operations work together to create fully integrated systems. Students work with artificial intelligence, robotics, and engineering design in a competitive and fun environment!
			</p>
			<h3>
				Competing at the Collegiate Level
			</h3>
			<p>
				We are preparing for the national SUAS competition, where our high school team will face off against university engineering programs from across the country.
			</p>
			<h2>SPEAK TO US</h2>
